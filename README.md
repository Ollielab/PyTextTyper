# PyTextWriter Documentation

## Installation

```
// pip import pytextwriter 
```

## Dependencies

PyTextWriter is dependent on [Art](https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/art), which is automatically setup. This means any functions that use Art might not function as intended due to compatability issues. The required version of Python is 3.6 and newer.&#x20;
